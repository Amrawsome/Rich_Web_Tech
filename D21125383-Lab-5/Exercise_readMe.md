1.Explain using code examples what is meant by props and state in
React JS?

Props are data passed into a react component. Props are apart of pure functions, you can't change a component modifying its own props.
The following function shows the use of props.
The car function takes props as an argument and in this case the garage function uses the car function and sets the brand prop to ford so the result will be "Who lives in my garage" then "I am a Ford".
function Car(props) {
return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}
function Garage() {
return (
<>
<h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
<Car brand="Ford" />
</>
);
}
ReactDOM.render(<Garage />, document.getElementById('root'));

The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A componentâ€™s state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.
The code below uses states to hold and change the name state to have it displayed.
The state starts as havving name as "World" once update name starts it changes the state name to Simplilearn so once rendering begins it will display the state name in the this not statename. So in short states hold info in this case name and can be changed by setting the state to something new and the new info will be displayed when its called.  
class Greetings extends React.Component {
  state = {
    name: "World"
  };
  updateName() {
    this.setState({ name: "Simplilearn" });
  }
  render() {
      return(
          <div>{this.state.name}</div>
      )
  }
}


2.In functional programming, what does the term functor mean? Can you give
an example in JavaScript?

A functor is a data object that can hold elements of any data type and which
implements the map operation (a function)

The javascript example below shows what a functor is. The code below unwarps the values applys a function to them or in this case does it twice and finally rewraps the value. So as shown below in this case the functor unwraps the values in the array applyies the function to the values reqraps it into an array then the second function will do the same and will rewrap the value in the context in this case an array. 

['123', '456', '789']
.map(s => parseInt(s))
.map(n => n / 10) // => [12.3, 45.6, 78.9]


3.We have looked at three kinds of asynchronous programming mechanisms, namely callbacks, promises and streams. Mention one advantage and one disadvantage of each type.

-Callbacks-
Advantage:
It allows for code to be run while the callback is being perfmormed. 

Disadvantage:
Further asynchronous requests require that it uses the first callbacks logic causing nested callbacks whihc are difficult to debug and to handle error cases.

-Promises-
Advantage:
Helps to mitigate the christmas tree of doom with the use of .then()
Disadvantage:
Without using the catch method errors may be ignored and cause problems down the line.

-Streams-
Advantage:
Streams increase the performance, even when the memory is limited
Disadvantage:
The Learning curve on streams is steep due to its complexity 

4.With the aid of a diagram and example code, describe the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) Box Model and show how it can be used to space DOM elements

The CSS Box Model is in essence a box that wraps around all html elements. Content, padding,borders and margins is what it consists of as seen in the picture below.


 ![css_box_model](css_box_model.png)



 HTML:
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html lang="en">
<head>    
 <meta charset="UTF-8">   
<div>
<p>Name: 30daysoflaptops.github.io</p>
<p>Description: null</p>
</div>   
</body>
</html>

Before
![box_model_1](box_model_1.png)

CSS:
#repo_list p{
    margin-left: 6px;
}


After
![box_model_2](box_model_2.png)

As you can see from the pitures above the text is attached to the left side but when you add margin styling to the element it pushes the element from the left out because the left side of the box is pushed out.

5.Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an initial URL.
